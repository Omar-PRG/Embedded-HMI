This repository hosts my internship projectâ€”an interactive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) created 
using MATLAB App Designer. The project's focus is on deploying an interface that 
allows users to pass model parameters in real time, simulate the model iteratively, and visually track key 
metrics like electric parking state, voltage, current, and torque force on a graph.
